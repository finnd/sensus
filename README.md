Sensus alpha.001

#[DESCRIPTION]

A work in progress ML/NN program for analyzing reddit post titles. Did I mention it is a work in progress?

#[TODO]

1.) Guarantee clean 8+1 outputs from title analysis

2.) Reduce 8+1 output scope (thinking divide by a large prime)

2.) Hope that the above solves the low neural network accuracy

3.) Continue as planned
